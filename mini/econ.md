## Glass-Steagall Act
The GSA was a law that separated commercial and investment banking. The summary
of it is that there is a difference in how money is invested
- Commercial Banks: Take deposits and make loans (low risk, low return)
- Investment Banks: Underwrite securities and trade stocks (high risk, high return)

Without the GSA, banks could take deposits and invest them in the stock market. So if the market crashed, the banks would lose their deposits and the economy would collapse. The GSA also created the **FDIC**, which insures deposits up to $250,000 to prevent bank runs, where people withdraw all their money at once.

The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA) ended the GSA in 1999, which most argue lead to 2008 (among other things).

The GLBA also allowed banks to merge with insurance companies and investment banks.
