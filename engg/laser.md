## Population Inversion
In stat-mech, population inversion when a system has more members of the system are in higher, excited states than in lower, unexcited energy states. It is called an "inversion" because in many familiar and commonly encountered physical systems, this is not possible.

## Simulated Emission
If an atom is in an excited state and a photon of the correct energy passes by, the atom can drop to a lower energy state and emit a photon of the same energy. This is called stimulated emission.

They key fact is that this emitted photon has both the same energy and phase as the incoming photon creating a coherent pair.
